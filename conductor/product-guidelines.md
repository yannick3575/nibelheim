# Visual Identity & Tone
Nibelheim adopts a **Functional & Accessible** style. The interface prioritizes clarity and ease of use, employing standard design patterns to ensure that learning and discovery are efficient and barrier-free.

# Design Principles
- **Data-First:** AI outputs and experiment results are the focus, presented with high clarity and sufficient detail to support analysis and learning.
- **Modular Architecture:** Features are developed as independent modules (e.g., Tech Watch, Prompt Library, Stochastic Lab), allowing for independent evolution and scaling.
- **Interactive Learning:** The platform encourages active experimentation through interfaces that provide real-time feedback when parameters are adjusted.

# Brand Messaging
Nibelheim is a personal laboratory for AI discovery. It should feel like a reliable, sophisticated tool that empowers the user to explore the frontiers of AI technology.
